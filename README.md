# :dart: Detection of Parkinson Disease using XGBoost 

## :nazar_amulet: Objective:
To build a model to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual.

## :nazar_amulet: What is Parkinson's Disease?
A disorder of the central nervous system that affects movement, often including tremors. Nerve cell damage in the brain causes dopamine levels to drop, leading to the symptoms of Parkinson's. Parkinson's often starts with a tremor in one hand. Other symptoms are slow movement, stiffness and loss of balance.

## :nazar_amulet: What is XGBoost Algorithm?
XGBoost is an algorithm that has recently been dominating applied machine learning and Kaggle competitions for structured or tabular data. XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance.
The two reasons to use XGBoost are also the two goals of the project:
### :small_orange_diamond: Execution Speed:
Generally, XGBoost is fast. Really fast when compared to other implementations of gradient boosting.
### :small_orange_diamond: Model Performance:
XGBoost dominates structured or tabular datasets on classification and regression predictive modeling problems.

## :nazar_amulet: Steps to detect Parkinson's disease using XGBoost:
1. Install following libraries: numpy , pandas , xgboost(from sklearn).
2. Import all the necessary libraries required.
3. Read the csv file into the dataframe.
4. Get the features and labels from the DataFrame (dataset).
5. Initialize a MinMaxScaler.
6. Scale the features to between -1 and 1 to normalize them. The MinMaxScaler transforms features by scaling them to a given range.
7. Use the fit_transform() method fits to the data and then transforms it.
8. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
9. Initialize an XGBClassifier and train the model.
10. Generate y_pred and calculate the accuracy for the model.

## :nazar_amulet: CONCLUSION:
Parkinson’s disease affects the central newvous system of the brain and has yet no treatment unless it’s detected early. Late detection leads to no treatment and loss of life. Thus its early detection is significant. For early detection of the disease, we utilized machine learning algorithm XGBoost to predict the onset of disease and save many lives.
